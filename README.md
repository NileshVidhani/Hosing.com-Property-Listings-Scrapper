# Indian---Govt---Schemes---Tracker
A web scraping project that uses BeautifulSoup and Python to gather, arrange, and filter Indian government schemes by department.


# Description of the Project
The Indian government offers a wide range of programs in various sectors, but the information is frequently dispersed and hard to find in one location.
This endeavor seeks to:

Use public portals to scrape Indian government schemes.

Use Pandas DataFrames to organize them in a structured manner.

Provide simple options for searching and filtering (future enhancement).


# Attributes:
Extracts General Schemes for you from india.gov.in.

Extracts Scheme Names and links.

Automatically cleans truncated URLs.

Categorizes the schemes by department (Currently: General).

More departments (tell us more, e.g. Education, Agriculture, Social Justice) coming soon.

Next: Filtering, exporting to CSV/Excel, interactive web UI.


# Technologies Implemented:
Python

BeautifulSoup

Pandas

Jupyter Notebook


# Future Scope:
Scrape schemes from multiple departments.

Provide filtering and search functionalities.

Export results to CSV or Excel.

Build a user-friendly web interface.
